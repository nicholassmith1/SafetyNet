# SafetyNet

Git Repository Courtesy Guidelines:
    - Linux style commits message (https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface-for-dirk/blob/a48494d2fbed58c751e9b7e8fbff88582f9b2d02/README#L88)
      In general, that means a meaningful single line description of the commit, a blank line, and 74 character line-wrapped full description of the change
    - Please develop new functionality on branches, then merge into master as independent fully-featured commits. The goal is to keep bisecting as easy as possible.
    - Please always leave master in a functional state
